  /*
  Case classes will generate correct implementations of these methods(equals, hasCode, toString) - equals, for example, will run a field-for-field comparison.
  The problem is that this breaks when you extend a case class: the subclass will inherit these methods,
  which are not aware of any field you might have added.
  This is the reason, you can no longer extend a case class by another case class, it has been forbidden since, I think scala 2.11.
  Extending a case class by a non-case class is still allowed, but isn't really a good idea.
