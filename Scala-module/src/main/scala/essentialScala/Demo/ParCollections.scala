  // There are both immutable and mutable parallel collections

  // How
  // imagine a collection being split into different chunks;
  // your algorithm is then applied to the chunks,
  // and at the end of the operation, the different chunks are recombined.

  // When
  // okay when your algorithm receives elements in an arbitrary order.
  // This means that algorithms like sum, max, min, mean, and filter will all work fine.

  // algorithm that depends on the collection elements being received in a
  // predictable order should not be used with a parallel collection

  // Performance
  // Using parallel collections wonâ€™t always make your code faster.
  // For a parallel algorithm to provide a benefit, a collection usually needs to be fairly large.
  // This is because using parallel collection has some overhead for distributing (fork) and gathering (join) the data between cores.
  // Due to the overhead of creating new threads, better performance is only obtained
  //  for operations which are CPU heavy per item in the collection, or when the
  //  collections are quite large
